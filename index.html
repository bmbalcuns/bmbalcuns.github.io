                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Breanna (Bre). I am want to know anything and everything! I've traveled all over the world, I'm fluent in Arabic, I dabble in photography, wish I was a model, love food, obsessed with my dog, and I think people are the most under-valued resource of life. Clearly my interests are vaired. In the interest of gaining new skills, my current endeavor is a computer programming course. This page has been created to show off the work I've done throughout the course that I am most proud of. Feel free to look around!</p>
